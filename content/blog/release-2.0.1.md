Good Morning!


I have just released v2.0.1. There are no world-shaking updates in it, but I have moved the livery chooser button on the left, next to the aircraft, so they are now closer to each other. This also means, that now you can use it with FMC without covering each other and you can use it also with the newly released Extra-Maritime-Structures by @TotallyRealElonMusk. If you haven't checked it out yet, you can find this great addon here: https://github.com/TotallyRealElonMusk/GeoFS-Extra-Maritime-Structures

I know, this addon is not useful with carriers yet, but in the near future some F16 support is yet to come (and probably E2 also, but I will need to ask for permission, before I do that)

Have a nice day/flight,
